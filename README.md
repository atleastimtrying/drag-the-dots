drag-the-dots
=============

This project not longer uses the rails back end and exists as a client only app on the firefox store. as such I'm open sourcing it.

phonegap src for drag the dots

to compile the coffeescript use the terminal coffeescript compiler

$ cd drag-the-dots
$ coffee -w -j script.js -c classes/*.coffee

If you're suggesting new features please make a new branch or issue a pull request from a private repo.

Enjoy!
